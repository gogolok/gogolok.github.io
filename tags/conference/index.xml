Ruby on Rails has become a well accepted and highly appreciated tool for building modern web apps. A complete and well cultivated eco system has been created over the years. Now the increasing demand for mobile applications raises a demand for well designed (JSON) APIs to talk to. It is not less than a perfect match.</description>

      <description>Last week, I was able to attend Euruko 2012 in Amsterdam with a few of my colleagues from Avarteq. We arrived thursday night, hence we missed the boat party at thursday night.
The conference was held in the Pathé Tuschinski. Pathé Tuschinski is a beautiful movie theatre. Nearly 600 attendees occupied the theatre, quite amazing, as the “Happy Friday Hug” depicts.
My favorite talk at the conference was “JRuby, dudes!” by Charles Nutter.</description>
